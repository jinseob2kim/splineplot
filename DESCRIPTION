Description: Creates 'ggplot2'-based visualizations of smooth effects from GAM (Generalized Additive Models)
    fitted with 'mgcv' and spline effects from GLM (Generalized Linear Models). Supports interaction terms
    and provides hazard ratio plots with histograms for survival analysis.
    Wood (2017, ISBN:9781498728331) provides comprehensive methodology for generalized additive models.
